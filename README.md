### GAME RULES:

* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

* In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.

* BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in any one of the dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game or we can set final score manually for winning the game.

* A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls 6 on both the dice at same time. After that, it's the next player's turn.
